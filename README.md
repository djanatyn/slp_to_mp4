# To Do
### Must Haves:
- Set Dolphin INI settings based on json file so no user has to edit INI files
    - String replacements in dolphin.ini and gfx.ini
- Filter short games
- Make recursive through folders and updates names accordingly
- Command Line prompt for settings if they don't exist, then set them
- Create Installer script


### Nice to Haves:
  - More error handling/checking
  - Option to record all > convert all as opposed to record, convert, record convert...


### Next Level:
- Specify config on command line for Dolphin so we dont have to create and keep track of which dolphin directory it's going in
- Maybe not possible due to slippi-desktop-app opening dolphin and Slippi r18 dolphin doesnt support command line config
- Cut out Slippi Desktop App
